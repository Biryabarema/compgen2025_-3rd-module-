The main objective of this module will be to introduce Multi-omics Data Integration Using Deep Learning approaches
## This course was taught by BIMSB bioinformatics platform / Akalin Lab and can be found in full context at https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/compgen_course_2025_module3
## The main learning goals:

- Why we need multi-omics for cancer (disease) research?
- Things to consider for data preprocessing
- What is a typical classical machine learning workflow? 
- Important concepts specific to deep learning (e.g. anatomy of a neural network, hyperparameter optimisation, loss functions, model evaluation metrics, feature attribution scoring methods for marker discovery)
- Deep learning approaches to multi-omics integration (different model architectures)
- Different applications of deep learning in cancer research (e.g. cancer subtyping, drug response prediction, survival modeling) 

There are many components that were introduced to demonstrate an end-to-end projects
